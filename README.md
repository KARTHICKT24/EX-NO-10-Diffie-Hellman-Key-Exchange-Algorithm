# EX-NO-10-Diffie-Hellman-Key-Exchange-Algorithm

## NAME : KARTHICK KISHORE T
## REG NO : 212223220042

## AIM:
To Implement Diffie Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm 

## Algorithm:

1. Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange is used for securely sharing a secret key between two parties over an insecure channel.

2. Initialization: Agree on a large prime number \( p \) and a primitive root \( g \) modulo \( p \) (both are public values).

3. Key Exchange Process: 
   - Each party selects a private key and calculates their public key using the formula \( g^{\text{private key}} \mod p \).
   - Each party then shares their public key with the other.

4. Secret Key Computation: 
   - Each party computes the shared secret key using the received public key and their own private key.

5. Security: The difficulty of computing discrete logarithms ensures that the shared key remains secure even if public values are intercepted.

## Program:

```
def power(base, exponent, mod):
    result = 1
    base = base % mod
    while exponent > 0:
        if exponent % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % mod
        exponent = exponent >> 1
        base = (base * base) % mod
    return result

def main():
    # Public parameters
    p = int(input("Enter a prime number (p): "))
    g = int(input("Enter a primitive root modulo p (g): "))

    # Private keys
    a = int(input("Enter private key for Alice (a): "))
    b = int(input("Enter private key for Bob (b): "))

    # Public keys
    A = power(g, a, p)  # Alice sends to Bob
    B = power(g, b, p)  # Bob sends to Alice

    # Shared secret keys
    secretA = power(B, a, p)
    secretB = power(A, b, p)

    print(f"\nPublic key generated by Alice: {A}")
    print(f"Public key generated by Bob: {B}")
    print(f"\nShared secret key (Alice): {secretA}")
    print(f"Shared secret key (Bob): {secretB}")

    if secretA == secretB:
        print("\nKey exchange successful. Shared secret established.")
    else:
        print("\nKey exchange failed. Keys do not match.")
```
